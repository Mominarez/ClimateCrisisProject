      <h3>Deaths from Carbon Emissions</h3>
      <p class="fact">
        The carbon emissions of the richest 1% in 2019 were enough to change global temperatures and lead to an estimated 1.3 million deaths. Emissions of the richest 1% will cause 1.3 million heat-related deaths between 2020 and 2030—roughly the equivalent of the entire population of Dallas.

      <h3>Future Temperature Rise</h3>
      <p class="fact">
        If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate as they were between 1988 and 2017, global temperatures could rise by 4°C by the end of the century.

      <h3>Meat Production Impact</h3>
      <p class="fact">
        Meat production is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes methane from cows and sheep, nitrous oxide from animal waste, and carbon dioxide released when forests are cut down to create grasslands for livestock.
